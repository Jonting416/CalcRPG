#CalcRPG

Hello!  I made this Calculator RPG back in 2012 using the TI-84 programming tools.  
You can upload it to any TI-84 through the use of a USB-A cable and play it by launching ARPGOPEN.

Unfortunately, due to the way GOTOs work in this language it does eventually crash due to memory leaks, but it should be fine for ~40 min of gameplay.

Enjoy!
